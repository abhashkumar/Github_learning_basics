Go to the folder 

git init > this will make sure the files are going to be tracked see there is a file created with .git

git status > on branch master no commit untracked files

git add > local directory to staging index

git commit > staging index to local repository

#sending files from directory to repository

hence write git add helloworld.txt and check status again

Now the final step for final commit sending to local repository

git commit -m "initial commit"

git remote add origin <url> > just added a remote named origin

This remote is your connection to your remote repository in GitHub. You can add as many remotes as you want.

Now that we have linked up our local repository with our remote one, we’re ready to push our code. But first, we have to add branches. Don’t worry about what branches are for now, we’ll go over them in a little bit. Just know that when you created your GitHub repository, it added a branch called master by default. 

Now, in your local machine, there will be two versions of all of your branches, remote and local. In your local machine, Git created a branch called master by default, so we will have to pull the remote master branch that has been made for us in our remote repository. So go ahead and run the following command

git push -u origin master

We are now left with remote branches. The remote repository that we created in GitHub maintains its own set of branches. In order to stay up do date with them, our local repository maintains a remote version of all the local branches. Go ahead and run the following command in your terminal

git branch --all
git pull origin master


But wait, we still need to know what branches are. Right. Basically, you can think of a branch as a parallel universe. Say you want to try out a new feature in your cool mobile app but do not want to mess up the work that’s already been done. In this scenario, you can create a separate branch and do that. If things start going south, you can ditch that entire branch and come back to your original branch like nothing happened. But if you feel that the new feature would be a great addition to the app, you can merge that new branch with the original one. By default, Git names its main branch as master. It can’t do version control without a main branch. So let’s create and delete some branches, shall we

git branch test_branch > for creating branches 

git checkout test_branch > for switching pointer

There are two important Git commands that you need to understand when it comes to remote branches because you’ll be using them pretty often. They are pull and fetch . We used pull a little while ago, remember? They essentially do the same thing, but there’s a small difference. When you do a fetch, Git updates origin/master (or whatever remote branch you are fetching). But when you do a pull , Git updates origin/master and merges master with it.
