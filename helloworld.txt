Go to the folder 

git init > this will make sure the files are going to be tracked see there is a file created with .git

git status > on branch master no commit untracked files

git add > local directory to staging index

git commit > staging index to local repository

#sending files from directory to repository

hence write git add helloworld.txt and check status again

Now the final step for final commit sending to local repository

git commit -m "initial commit"

git remote add origin <url> > just added a remote named origin

This remote is your connection to your remote repository in GitHub. You can add as many remotes as you want.

Now that we have linked up our local repository with our remote one, we’re ready to push our code. But first, we have to add branches. Don’t worry about what branches are for now, we’ll go over them in a little bit. Just know that when you created your GitHub repository, it added a branch called master by default. 

Now, in your local machine, there will be two versions of all of your branches, remote and local. In your local machine, Git created a branch called master by default, so we will have to pull the remote master branch that has been made for us in our remote repository. So go ahead and run the following command

git push -u origin master

git pull origin master
